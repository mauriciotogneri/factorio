# Factorio

## General
* survive X amount of enemy waves
* structure sizes: 1 (1x1), 2 (2x2) and 3 (3x3)
* structures can be improved: the bigger the level, the more efficient/powerful but the more energy they require
* save automatically after X seconds
* move camera with ASDW

## Resources

### Primary
* coal ore
* iron ore
* copper ore
* stone ore
* energy

### Secondary
* iron plate = iron ore + coal ore
* copper plate = copper ore + coal ore
* stone brick = stone ore + coal ore

### Tertiary
* steel beam = iron plate + coal ore

### Ammo
* firearm magazine = iron plate + cooper plate
* piercing rounds magazine = steel beam + cooper plate
* cannon shell = steel beam + iron plate + cooper plate

## Structures

### Factories
* gear factory = iron plate
* engine = gear + steal beam + copper plate
* batteries = iron plate + copper plate

### Mines
* coal mine
* iron mine
* copper mine
* stone mine

### Connections
* conveyor belt (level 1: moves one element/click, level 2: moves 2 elements/click) They are bidirectional
* junction: only allows resources to continue moving in the same direction
* router: distribute items to all three other directions (alternating)
* sorter: selects a list of objects that will allow to pass in the same direction they came. all other resources will go the two other ways (alternating)
* overflow: allows resources to continue in the same direction but if it's full, it will send them in the two other directions

### Power plants
* solar plant
* wind plant
* coal plant

### Turrets: (hp + shield + attack + range)
* light turret (firearm magazine) = iron plate + copper plate + gear
* heavy turret (piercing rounds magazine) = steel beam + copper plate + gear
* cannon turret (cannon shell) = stone brick + steel beam + copper plate + gear + engine
* laser turret (no ammo but uses more power) = stone brick + steel beam + copper plate + gear + batteries
* plasma turret (no ammo but uses more power) = stone brick + steel beam + copper plate + gear + batteries + engine

### Walls: (hp + shield)
* stone wall = stone brick
* iron wall = iron plate
* steal wall = steel beam

### Misc
* headquarters
* research lab
    - weapons research (increases fire power)
    - shield research (increases shield)
    - armor research (increases hp)
    - energy research (increases range)

## Enemies
* coming form sides and just smashing across
* coming from sides and shooting

## Extras
* electric pole
* power line
* wood
* water
* gas
* gas power plant
* oil power plant
* mines
* oil
* uranium/plutonium
* barrel = iron + coal
* oil barrel = oil + barrel + coal
* plutonium barrel = plutonium + barrel + coal
* empty barrel
* plastic bar
* pipe
* oil refinery
* chemical plant
* geothermal plant
* nuclear plant
* circuit
* warehouse
