# Factorio

## General
* survive certain amount of enemy waves
* building sizes: 1 (1x1), 2 (2x2) and 3 (3x3)
* buildings can be improved: the bigger the level, the more efficient/powerful but the more energy they require
* save automatically after X seconds
* move camera with ASDW
* mines?

## Resources
* primary
    * coal
    * iron
    * copper
    * stone
    * energy
    * oil
    * uranium/plutonium
* secondary
    * barrel = iron + coal
    * iron plate = iron + coal
    * copper cable = copper + coal
    * stone brick = stone + coal
* tertiary
    * steal plate = iron plate + coal
    * oil barrel = oil + barrel + coal
    * plutonium barrel = plutonium + barrel + coal

## Factories produce
* gear
* ammo
* engine
* circuit
* plastic bar
* pipe
* batteries
* empty barrel?

## Buildings
* warehouse (level 1: 100 of each item, level 2: 200 of each item)
* oil refinery
* chemical plant
* silo?

## Mines
* oil mine
* coal mine
* iron mine
* copper mine
* stone mine

## Power plants
* solar plant
* wind plant
* coal plant
* geothermal plant
* nuclear plant

## Connections
* conveyor belt (level 1: moves one element/click, level 2: moves 2 elements/click) They are bidirectional
* junction: only allows resources to continue moving in the same direction
* router: distribute items to all three other directions (alternating)
* sorter: selects a list of objects that will allow to pass in the same direction they came. all other resources will go the two other ways (alternating)
* overflow: allows resources to continue in the same direction but if it's full, it will send them in the two other directions
* electric pole
* power line

## Turrets: (hp + shield + attack + range)
* light turret (bullets)
* heavy turret (bullets)
* cannon turret (rockets)
* laser turret (use no bullets but uses more power)
* ion turret (use no bullets but uses more power)
* plasma turret (use no bullets but uses more power)

## Walls: (hp + shield)
* stone wall
* iron
* steal

## Research
* lab
* weapons research (increases fire power)
* shield research (increases shield)
* armor research (increases hp)
* energy research (increases range)

## Enemies
* coming form sides and just smashing across
* coming from sides and shooting

## Extras
* wood?
* water?
* gas?
* gas power plant?
* oil power plant?
